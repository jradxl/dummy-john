DummyJohn
==========

The contents for the ArchLinux-DummyJohn example

This represents the source or release of the package you wish to build/install on Arch/Manjaro Linux.

The files here need to be archived to dummyjohn-X.Y.Z.tar.gz using the release part of github.
It is github's release URL (i.e. https://github.com/jradxl/dummyjohn/releases/download/v0.1.1/dummyjohn-0.1.1.tar.gz) that is accessed by the ArchLinux install package that I have prepared in my repository archlinux-dummyjohn.
